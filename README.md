# Running Coupling in the Standard Model and Beyond

In particle physics, we deal with three fundamental forces of Nature (gravity is considered too weak to be included). It has been found that the strengths of each of these forces is not constant, but dependent on the amount of energy in a collision. As the forces' strengths - or coupling - vary at different energy scales, there is a possibility that these forces could unify at a single point. This is interesting, as then we could postulate that the three forces we see at 'low' energy scales are actually three manifestations of the same unified force at a higher energy.

I was asked to compare various theories of particle physics and see whether they admit unification. I did this using Python to solve series of simultaneous differential equations.

This project is an archive of my final year Particle Physics project, submitted as part of my Masters in 2011.

## In This Repository

- [Code](Code) contains the Python code I used to investigate the area of running coupling. It solves series of differential equations to determine the unification point of the fundamental forces.
- [Interim Report](Interim Report) outlines the first stage of the project: testing that the solutions provided by my code agreed with solutions from other authors.
- [Final Report](Final Report) is my final submission for my Masters project, taking the results from the Interim Report and extending it to exotic theories of beyond Standard Model physics.
- [Seminar](Seminar) is a presentation given as part of the project, explaining everything in the Final Report in less than 15 minutes!

## What I used

- For the code you will need [Python 2](https://www.python.org/); more information is given in the [code's README](Code/README.md).
- [PDF](https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/)s are provided for the Final Report and the Interim Report; to build it yourself, you will need [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
- A PDF for the Seminar is also provided, together with an [OpenOffice.org presentation](https://www.openoffice.org/) and an exported [Microsoft PowerPoint presentation](https://www.office.com/).
